# Final Exam (Logical Networks Project) A.Y. 2022-2023
Prova Finale (Progetto di Reti Logiche) A.A. 2022-2023

## Introduction
This project presents the implementation of a logical network system using Vivado and VHDL. The system integrates a datapath and a Finite State Machine (FSM) to process inputs, access memory, and generate four parallel outputs. Notably, the final description of the component has been successfully synthesized as a real component using Vivado.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to design and synthesize a logical network system capable of efficiently processing inputs and producing four parallel outputs. Utilizing Vivado and VHDL, the system aims to demonstrate robust functionality and performance in real-world applications.

## Implementation
The implementation of the logical network system is achieved through Vivado, a powerful tool for designing and synthesizing FPGA-based digital circuits. VHDL is utilized to describe the behavior of the system components, including the datapath and FSM. The successful synthesis of the final component ensures that the design is ready for deployment onto physical hardware.

## Final score
The final score for this project was 30/30.
